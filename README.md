# Bitlayer Omnity Demo

This repository contains a demo application that interacts with Omnity on the Bitlayer, functioning as a LuckyPot.

Users can cross-chain mint 1 UNCOMMON‚Ä¢GOODS into this LuckyPot contract by making a deposit. When the contract holds UNCOMMON‚Ä¢GOODS, users can enter their Bitcoin address and click ‚ÄúDraw‚Äù to participate in the raffle. The draw can result in one of three outcomes:

	1.	1 UNCOMMON‚Ä¢GOODS is redeemed to the user‚Äôs provided Bitcoin address.
	2.	1 UNCOMMON‚Ä¢GOODS is transferred cross-chain to the user‚Äôs corresponding account on BEVM.
	3.	1 UNCOMMON‚Ä¢GOODS is destroyed.
